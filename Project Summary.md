### Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

#### 1. Problem Definition
The objective of this project is to determine if a patient has heart disease based on their clinical parameters. This involves using machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease.

#### 2. Data
The data used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains medical information about patients, including their age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, thalium stress test result, and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

#### 3. Evaluation
The success of the model is determined by its accuracy in predicting heart disease. The goal is to achieve at least 95% accuracy during the proof of concept phase.

#### 4. Features
The dataset includes the following features:
1. **age** - Age in years
2. **sex** - Gender (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. **cp** - Chest pain type (0: Typical angina, 1: Atypical angina, 2: Non-anginal pain, 3: Asymptomatic)
4. **trestbps** - Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
5. **chol** - Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
6. **fbs** - Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. **restecg** - Resting electrocardiographic results (0: Nothing to note, 1: ST-T wave abnormality, 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy)
8. **thalach** - Maximum heart rate achieved
9. **exang** - Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. **oldpeak** - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. **slope** - Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0: Upsloping, 1: Flat, 2: Downsloping)
12. **ca** - Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
13. **thal** - Thalium stress test result (1,3: Normal, 6: Fixed defect, 7: Reversible defect)
14. **target** - Presence of heart disease (1 = yes; 0 = no)

#### 5. Data Exploration
The initial data exploration involves examining the dataset to understand its structure and content. This includes checking for missing values, visualizing distributions, and exploring relationships between features and the target variable. 

#### 6. Modelling
Several machine learning models are tested, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest Classifier. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of these models. 

#### 7. Experimentation
The experimentation phase involves tuning the models to achieve the best performance. This may include hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV. The final model's performance is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

### Summary
This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict heart disease based on clinical data. Through thorough data exploration, feature analysis, and model tuning, the goal is to develop a robust model capable of achieving high accuracy in predicting heart disease, which can potentially aid in early diagnosis and treatment planning.


### Conclusions from the Classification Report

After evaluating the machine learning models using the classification report, several key metrics provide insights into the performance of each model. Here are the conclusions based on these metrics:

1. **Accuracy**
   - **Definition**: Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
   - **Observation**: The model's overall performance is satisfactory if the accuracy is high, indicating that most predictions (both positive and negative) are correct. For this project, an accuracy of 95% or higher was targeted.

2. **Precision**
   - **Definition**: Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions (true positives + false positives). It indicates the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model.
   - **Observation**: High precision means that when the model predicts heart disease, it is likely correct. This is crucial in medical diagnostics to reduce false positives and unnecessary treatments.

3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**
   - **Definition**: Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives (true positives + false negatives). It measures the modelâ€™s ability to correctly identify all actual positive cases.
   - **Observation**: High recall is important for ensuring that most actual cases of heart disease are identified, minimizing the risk of missing patients who need medical attention.

4. **F1 Score**
   - **Definition**: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall.
   - **Observation**: A high F1 score indicates that the model maintains a good balance between precision and recall, which is important for a reliable diagnostic tool.

5. **Support**
   - **Definition**: Support refers to the number of actual instances in each class (heart disease present or not present).
   - **Observation**: Balanced support across classes indicates a well-distributed dataset, helping to ensure that the model's performance is not biased towards one class.

### Model Performance Summary
Based on the classification report, the following conclusions can be drawn about the model's performance:

- **High Accuracy**: The models achieved high accuracy, indicating they are effective at predicting heart disease.
- **Balanced Precision and Recall**: The precision and recall scores were balanced, ensuring that the model is both accurate in its positive predictions and comprehensive in identifying actual cases.
- **Robust F1 Score**: The F1 score was high, reflecting a good balance between precision and recall, making the model reliable for practical use.

### Implications
The results from the classification report suggest that the selected machine learning model(s) are well-suited for predicting heart disease with a high degree of accuracy and reliability. These models can potentially assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning, thereby improving patient outcomes.

In conclusion, the classification report provides strong evidence that the developed models can effectively predict heart disease, meeting the project's goal of achieving high accuracy and balanced performance across key metrics.
